##Difference in `require()` and `define()` 

- The `require()` function is used to run immediate functionalities.
- The `define()` is used to define modules for use in multiple locations.


## require() vs. requireJS()

- Both are same.
- The AMD standard calls for a function thatâ€™s named `require()`.
  They provide a `requirejs()` alias to their main, AMD standard function.
